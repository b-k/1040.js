This is an interactive web page intended to help you understand your U.S. taxes.

* What is the overall flow from W-2s and 1099s to the final refund?

* If my tax situation changes, like buying a house or having a kid, how does the shape of my taxes change?

* People keep telling me that having an IRA will reduce my tax bill. By how much?

* If I had a million dollars, what would my taxes look like? What would they look like
if I made it all in capital gains?

* My mom/dad/libertarian friend complains about how taxes are overwhelmingly complicated, but I don't
think they're so crazy difficult. How can I walk them through the process?

* A lawmaker has proposed changing tax law, like a flat tax or changing the mortgage
interest deduction to a mortgage interest credit. How can I get an idea of what those
changes would look like?

Doing your taxes
========

If your sole interest is to "do" your taxes, there are many online services that will
take in a list of numbers from you and spit out a bottom-line number, hiding what
happens between beginning and end.

You can also file directly with the IRS using FFFF [ https://www.freefilefillableforms.com ].
IRS form 1040 was first developed in 1913, and largely retains the same organization
as the original. Technically, it does not hide intermediate steps from the user, but
it is hard to argue that its layout of a long list of lines, many of which refer to
lines on other forms, makes the flow especially clear.

The tax graph on this form is incomplete. For example, the earned income credit
calculation is in place, but if you are a member of the clergy there is a different
calculation. The code is open source, and you are encouraged to add cells or logical
nuances that apply to your situation; see Contributing.md for details.
